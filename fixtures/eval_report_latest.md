## Insights

### Token Savings Distribution
The token savings ranged from 43.3% to 94.7%,
with a median of 71.8%. This demonstrates CodeGrapher's ability to
significantly reduce context size while maintaining relevant information.

### Retrieval Quality
With a median recall of 100.0%, CodeGrapher successfully retrieves most of the
files actually edited in real-world development tasks. The precision of 14.3%
indicates that the tool includes additional context files beyond just the edited files, which is expected
and desirable for providing comprehensive context to the LLM.
