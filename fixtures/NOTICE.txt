USE OF THESE REPOSITORIES FOR TESTING

These repositories are used for testing purposes only to validate CodeGrapher's
token-saving capabilities. The testing process involves:

1. Cloning repositories to temporary directories
2. Checking out specific commits referenced in the ground truth dataset
3. Running CodeGrapher indexing and querying operations
4. Measuring token usage and retrieval metrics
5. Cleaning up temporary files

No modified code from these repositories is distributed with CodeGrapher.
All usage complies with the respective licenses' terms for testing and evaluation.

For questions about licensing or attribution, please contact the project maintainer.
